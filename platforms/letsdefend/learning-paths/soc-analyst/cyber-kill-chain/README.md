## 🧠 Key Takeaways by Lesson

### 1. Introduction to Cyber Kill Chain
- Overview of the Cyber Kill Chain framework developed by Lockheed Martin.  
- Importance of understanding attack stages for effective defense.

### 2. Cyber Kill Chain Steps
- Detailed explanation of the seven stages: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and Actions on Objectives.

### 3. Reconnaissance
- Attackers gather information about the target using OSINT, scanning, and other methods.  
- Goal is to identify vulnerabilities and plan the attack.

### 4. Weaponization
- Creation of malicious payloads tailored to exploit identified vulnerabilities.  
- Combining exploits with backdoors or malware.

### 5. Delivery
- Transmission of the weaponized payload to the target via phishing emails, USB drives, or other vectors.  
- First point of contact between attacker and victim.

### 6. Exploitation
- Execution of the malicious code on the target system.  
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain access.

### 7. Installation
- Establishing persistence by installing malware or backdoors.  
- Ensuring continued access to the compromised system.

### 8. Command and Control (C2)
- Establishing communication channels between the compromised system and the attacker’s infrastructure.  
- Allows attackers to remotely control the system.

### 9. Actions on Objectives
- Achieving the attacker’s goals, such as data exfiltration, system disruption, or lateral movement.  
- Final stage where the impact of the attack is realized.

### 10. Cyber Kill Chain Quiz
- Assessment to test understanding of each stage and associated techniques.
